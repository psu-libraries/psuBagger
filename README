# Tricerabagger

Helpful information will eventually go here.

AWS CLI must be configured for each user who sends content to APTrust or runs the tricerabagger scripts. As of 2106-12-16, permission were not as we had discussed so I frequently have to do things as sudo. tallmann and root both have AWS credentials configured.
