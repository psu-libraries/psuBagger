# Ideally will not rsync from server to server, but rsync on ojs server to libbag mount and then process form libarcmat1
# When rsyncing content from OJS server, don't use -a command as usually, this will copy broken sym links which will cause bagit-python to fail.
# Exclude cache and pdf plugin dir -- not necessary to include, not unique content and will be re-installed with OJS -- filenames cause problems.
# sudo rsync -h -vv -r -L --exclude 'cache' --exclude 'plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer/pdf.js/web/images' journals.uc.edu/* tallmann@digital.libraries.uc.edu:ojs/ -- ideally you rsync directly to libarcmat1, but permission are not complete. The broken sym links are in the PKP-OJS github repo too, never distributed.

# You will also need to grab a mysqldump of the database. Instructions below from Glen. -- can automate this when able.
#1) Log into the OJS production server
#2) mysqldump -h ucdbeil6.private -u wbu_journals -p journals > ~/ojs_production_dump.mysql
#3) Youâ€™ll then be prompted for a password that can be found on line 109 of /srv/www/journals.uc.edu/config.inc.php
#4) The file will be saved to ojs_production_dump.mysql in your home directory.
