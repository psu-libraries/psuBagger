## DESCRIPTION
The BAGIT LIBRARY is a software library intended to support the creation, 
manipulation, and validation of bags. Its current version is 0.97. It is version aware with the earliest
supported version being 0.93.

## REQUIREMENTS
* Java 7
* gradle

## BUILD
Inside the bagit-java root directory, run `gradle distZip`. This will create a .zip file under build/distributions,
bagit-\<VERSION\>.zip. To create an office release you should specify the version by running `gradle distZip -Pversion=<VERSION>` 

## COMMANDLINE
A commandline interface is provided to perform various operations on bag. Unzip
bagit-\<VERSION\>.zip and change into the resulting 'bagit-\<VERSION\>/bin' subdirectory,
where you will find scripts to invoke the commandline interface. To learn more
about the supported operations, invoke ./bag or bag.bat with no arguments. If you
encounter memory issues, the memory allocation can be increased in the scripts found
in the bin directory.

### NOTE IF USING WITH ECLIPSE
Simply run `gradle eclipse` and it will automatically create a eclipse project for you that you can import.

### FILENAMES WITH BACKSLASHES
The BagIt specification requires that the only valid path separator is the forward slash /. Thus, a
backslash ( \ ) in a file name is completely legal.  However, due to a shortcoming in Commons VFS
backslashes are supported by BIL.  Given platform compatability issues, this is not necessarily
a bad thing.

### RELEASE NOTES

#### Changes in 4.10.0
1. Fixes defect in SimpleResult.add*Message() methods.
2. Reports an error when verifying payloads for a bag with no payload manifests.
3. Fix bugs causing streams to be left open after an exception is thrown.
4. Upgraded Commons Compress to 1.8.1.

#### Changes in 4.9.0
1. Bug fix for normalization conversion between stored manifest filenames and filenames on disk.
2. Fixed bug in zip compression.
3. Upgraded numerous dependencies.
4. Removed all LC-specific configuration from pom.
5. Added .travis.yml for integration with travis-ci (http://travis-ci.com/).
6. Fixed problems so that compiles under Java 8.

#### Changes in 4.8.1
1. Bug fix to FileSystemWriter to handle files that did do not already exist.
2. Bug fix to SizeHelper.

#### Changes in 4.8
1. Added additional convenience method to FileHelper.

#### Changes in 4.7
1. Handle NPE when encountering improperly formatted bag-info.txt.
2. Added progress reports to bag fetch. 

#### Changes in 4.6
1. Added tag file fetch-progress.txt to support progressive fetch and verification.  The file 
	will be removed once the bag is successfully fetched.  In BagFetcher, added verification
	of a fetched file against the checksum in the manifest file.  Added switch verify to fill 
	holey bag and fetch remote bag command-line operations.  This option enables bag verification 
	before the fetch is resumed.
	
#### Changes in 4.5.1
1. Added missing braces to conditional blocks in ValidHoleyBagVerifier.  This caused false
	error message when verifying a holey bag.

#### Changes in 4.5
1. Adds support for bag-info.txt values that contain line terminators.

#### Changes in 4.4
1. Attempt to correct for unicode normalization form in filepaths. Note: Java has
    problems dealing with differences in unicode normalization form 
    (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/tr15-23.html) in filepaths.
    In particular, it is sometimes the case that a java.io.File is that produced
    by java.io.File.listFiles() will fail java.io.File.exists(). This attempts to
    correct for this by trying java.io.File.exists() using different normalization
    forms for the filepath.
2. Improves error handling and logging in FileSystemHelper and TempFileHelper.
3. Added support for writing by copying and moving to FileSystemHelper.  The default
	is now to copy (instead of writing the stream exposed by BagFile).  Added support
	for specifying move in CommandLineBagDriver (--move).
4. Added setUsername()/setPassword() interfaces to all bag fetchers to support
	concurrent clients; each client's credentials will be local to each instance of bag fetcher. 	

#### Changes in 4.3.1
1. Changes to pom for maven 3.
2. Fix for NPE in SimpleMessage.

#### Changes in 4.3
1. To enhance ability to machine-process SimpleResult, refactored to allow the
    recording of codes, with subject and objects.
2. Removed BagVerifyResult.
3. Fixes defect with zipped bags on Windows.
4. Fixes NPE when splitting bag by size without a bag-info.txt.
5. Added support for limiting additions, updates, and deletes from tag manifests
    using TagManifestVerifierCompleter.
6. Added UpdatePayloadOxumCompleter and added support to commandline driver.
7. Added PayloadOxumVerifier.

#### Changes in 4.2
1. Changed most interfaces to extends Closeable instead of declaring own close() method.
2. Improved safety of stream closing throughout code.

#### Changes in 4.1
1. Fixes excessive logging.

#### Changes in 4.0
1. Added support for BagIt 0.97. The significant change is allowing tag directories. (Note that operations
	are version aware, meaning pre-0.97 bags do not allow tag directories.)
2. Removes Commons VFS.
3. Deprecates support for reading/writing tar, tar bz2, and tar gz.
4. Deprecates support for transferring SWORD and BOB.
5. Added close() method to Bag for closing IO resources. 
6. Clarified logging messages for CompleteVerifier and ValidVerifier.
7. Changed so that bagging-in-place throws an exception if a prebag contains a data directory and tag directories
	for pre-0.97 bags.
8. Added support for fail modes when performing verification:
    * FAIL_FAST:  Fail on first error.
    * FAIL_SLOW:  Fail at end of verification.
    * FAIL_STEP:  Fail after each step of verification. A step is a set of like verification operations.
    * FAIL_STAGE:  Fail after each stage of verification. A stage is a set of logically grouped
			verification operations. For example, when validating a bag, all of the operations to verify
			that a bag is complete is a stage.
9. Added support for compressing zip files.
10. Replaced Commons Httpclient with Apache HttpComponents.

#### Changes in 3.13
1. Added support for keeping empty directories when bagging in place.
2. Increased default MAXMEM to 1024m.

5. Upgraded to Commons IO 2.0.1.

1. Added support to FileSystemWriter to only write files that had mismatch between
	manifest and files on disk.

#### Changes in 3.10
1. Added additional list methods to BagInfoTxt.
2. Added chaining completer.

3. Writer (formerly BagWriter), Completeter (formerly CompletionStrategy), Hole Puncher (formerly Bag.makeHoley())
